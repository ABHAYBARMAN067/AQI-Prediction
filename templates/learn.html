        <p>
            The <strong>Air Quality Index (AQI)</strong> is a valuable tool that helps us understand how clean or
            polluted the air around us is. It measures the concentration of various harmful pollutants such as
            particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>),
            carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).
            The AQI simplifies this data into a scale that informs us about the potential health risks of the air we
            breathe daily.
        </p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle icon" aria-hidden="true"></i>Why is AQI Important?</h2>
        <p>
            With growing urbanization and industrialization, air pollution has become a serious concern worldwide.
            Breathing polluted air can lead to severe health problems, damage the environment, and lower the quality of
            life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AQI scale ranges from <strong>0 to 500</strong>. Lower values mean cleaner air, while higher values
            indicate more pollution. It is divided into categories like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Good</strong> â€“ Air quality is satisfactory and poses little or no risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate</strong> â€“ Acceptable air quality but may affect sensitive individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Unhealthy</strong> â€“ Everyone may experience health effects; sensitive groups more seriously
                affected.</li>
            <li><strong>Hazardous</strong> â€“ Serious health effects for everyone; emergency conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-heartbeat icon" aria-hidden="true"></i>How Does Air Pollution Affect Our Health?</h2>
        <p>
            When AQI is high, it means the air contains elevated levels of pollutants that can deeply penetrate our
            lungs and bloodstream, causing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Respiratory Issues:</strong> Worsening asthma, bronchitis, and other lung diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Cardiovascular Effects:</strong> Increased risks of heart attacks, strokes, and inflammation.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Brain Health:</strong> Long-term exposure can impact cognitive function and increase
                neurological disorder risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerable Groups:</strong> Children, elderly, pregnant women, and those with existing health
                conditions are more at risk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf icon" aria-hidden="true"></i>What Can We Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Staying updated with daily AQI reports helps us take precautions, like limiting outdoor activities during
            high pollution days, using air purifiers indoors, and supporting clean energy initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Governments and environmental organizations also use AQI data to enforce policies to reduce emissions and
            protect public health.
        </p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-smile-beam icon" aria-hidden="true"></i>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding the Air Quality Index is vital for protecting our lungs, heart, brain, and overall well-being.
            By being informed and proactive, we can ensure cleaner air and a healthier environment for ourselves and
            future generations. <span aria-label="Plant emoji" role="img">ðŸŒ±</span>
